# CONTRIBUTING

Outside contributions to this project are welcome.

**Before spending lots of time on something, ask for feedback on your idea first!**

Please search issues and pull requests before adding something new, to avoid
duplication of effort and past conversations.

This project welcomes non-code contributions, too! The following types of contributions are welcome:

* Ideas: participate in an issue thread or start your own.
* Writing: contribute your expertise in an area by helping expand the included content.
* Copy editing: fix typos, clarify language, and generally improve the quality of the content.
* Formatting: help keep content easy to read with consistent formatting.

# Project governance

This is an Open Source Software project. Individuals making significant and valuable
contributions will be granted commit access to the project to contribute as they see
fit. This project is more like an open wiki than a standard Open Source project.

## Rules

There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors:

* No `--force` pushes or modifying the project Git history in any way.
* **Non-main branches** should be used for ongoing work.
* Internal pull-requests to solicit feedback are encouraged for any other non-trivial
contribution but left to the discretion of the contributor.
* Contributors should attempt to adhere to the prevailing code style.

## Releases

Declaring formal releases remains the prerogative of the project maintainers.
